/** IMPORTANT:
 * There was an error during the rooting of the HiveSight. GPIO 34 and GPIO 35 were selected as
 * the user GPIOs on the WROOM module, but they are only workin in input mode. To fix this, the chip
 * select was changed with the user 0 for both the WROOM and the SOC modules. This was done so that
 * only the code on the ESP needed to be recompiled, since it is easier. The flag below can be
 * changed to set the proper configuration. Make sure not to commit any change to it: by default,
 * it should always be set to SPI_CONFIG_WROOM.
